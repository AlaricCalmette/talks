# NodeConf EU

- **Title:** Building a radio data network with Node.js
- **Date:** 2017-11-08
- **Location:** Kilkenny, Ireland

## Abstract

A fun and nerdy talk introducing the audience to the concept of encoding
bits onto a radio wave. Weâ€™ll learn how to pack data tightly to achieve
high bandwidth and how to recover from data loss without retransmission.
The theories will be put to the test using a Software Defined Radio
built using nothing but Node.js and a few radio parts.
