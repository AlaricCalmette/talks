# JS Kongress

- **Title:** Building a radio data network with Node.js
- **Date:** 2017-11-13
- **Location:** Munich, Germany

## Abstract

A nerdy talk introducing the audience to the concept of encoding bits
onto a radio wave. Weâ€™ll lean how to pack data tightly to achieve high
bandwidth and how to recover from data loss without retransmission. The
theories will be put to the test using a Software Defined Radio built
using nothing but Node.js and some radio parts.
