## Abstract

Bonjour/Zeroconf is used to automatically configure and connect to
networked devices like printers on a LAN and is widely deployed in
offices and homes. This talk gives an introduction to the Zeroconf
standard and shows how itâ€™s vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack.

The talk will show how Zeroconf can be exploited to allow a
man-in-the-middle attack on any Zeroconf enabled device. This allows you
to intercept anything from print jobs to admin panel passwords.
