- **Location:** Bucharest, Romania

The code contained in the folder `example-app` is a showcase of how the
Node.js Event Loop can be patched with and without using AsyncWrap.

## Abstract

This talk is a head first dive into the next-gen core tracing API’s
being developed under the Node.js Tracing Working Group. We’ll learn
