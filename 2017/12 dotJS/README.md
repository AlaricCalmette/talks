- **Location:** Paris, France

## Abstract

Commercial airplanes continuously transmit data packages via radioÂ while
flying. The protocol is unencrypted and is what allows public flight
tracking websites to operate. In this talk you'll learn how a cheap $10
USB DVB-T/FM radio dongle off Amazon can be hacked to receive these
signals live and directly in JavaScript.
