## Abstract

Capture and transmit radio waves using software (and just a tiny bit of
hardware). This talk is about SDR (Software Defined Radio) and how you
can listen to and transcode the radio spectrum using Node.js. It allows
you to interact with IoT devices, debug cellular meta-data, and
intercept commercial and private airplane communication.
